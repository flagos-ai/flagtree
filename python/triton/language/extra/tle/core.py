    Iterator that counts upward forever, with parallel execution semantics.

    This is a special iterator used to implement similar semantics to Python's :code:`range` in the context of
    :code:`triton.jit` functions. In addition, it allows user to pass extra attributes to the compiler.
    :param bind_sub_block: Tells the compiler if multiple vector cores participate in the loop.
        This is used in the mixed cube-vector kernel on 910B. The number of vector cores is determined by the number of
        iteration in this loop. Currently on 910B, max 2 vector cores could be used.
